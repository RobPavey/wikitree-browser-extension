This adds two buttons to the header in the same place as the clipboard buttons:

- Binoculars: See the Extra Watchlist.
- Plus sign: Add (remove) profiles to (from) the Extra Watchlist. (Only shown on profile/space pages.)

Each column of the table - ID, Name, and Changed - is sortable.  
There is one option for default sorting.
The Extra Watchlist is just a list of IDs saved in localStorage.
