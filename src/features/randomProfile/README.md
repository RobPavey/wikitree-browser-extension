This is Jamie's code. :) It takes a little maintenance to update the number of profiles in the database, but it's useful. Maybe someone can add something to get the new total number of profiles?

Left-click to get any random profile. Right-click to choose a location. This location is then used for all Random Profile calls until it is changed.
